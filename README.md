## ⚠️ Limitations
- The study focused on professionals from a single university setting, limiting its representation of the broader workforce.
- The sample size was relatively small, affecting the generalizability of the findings.
- Data was self-reported, which introduces potential bias as participants may underreport negative experiences or exaggerate positives.

## 📚 Future Research Directions & Implications
- Future research should examine work-life balance across various industries and geographical regions for broader insights.
- Long-term studies on the effectiveness of workplace policies and personal strategies would offer deeper understanding.
- Organizations are encouraged to implement flexible work arrangements and stress management resources.
- Professionals should consider time management techniques and setting clear boundaries to maintain balance.
